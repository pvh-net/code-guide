# NAU Front End Code Guide

This guide derived from [Code Guide](http://codeguide.co) which is a project for documenting standards for developing flexible, durable, and sustainable HTML and CSS. It comes from years of experience writing code on projects of all sizes. It's not the end-all be-all, but it's a start.
